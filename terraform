Core Concepts & Architecture

State Management

How do you handle Terraform state in a team environment?

What happens if your terraform.tfstate file is lost or corrupted? How do you recover?

How does remote state locking work and what backends support it?

Can you manually edit the terraform.tfstate file? When is it safe/unsafe?

Lifecycle & Resource Behavior

Explain create_before_destroy vs prevent_destroy. When would you use them?

What happens if you manually delete a resource outside of Terraform?

What will terraform plan and terraform apply do next?

How do you import existing infrastructure into Terraform?

Provisioners & Dependencies

Why are provisioners considered a last resort?

Explain depends_on and implicit dependency creation.

How do you handle cases where a resource has a dynamic dependency on another?

Complex Scenarios

Modules

How do you version control and share Terraform modules across multiple teams?

How do you make a module reusable across different environments (dev/stage/prod)?

Difference between locals vs variables inside a module.

Workspaces

When do you prefer workspaces over separate state files?

Can you explain pitfalls of workspaces for managing environments?

Data Sources

How do you use data sources to fetch existing resources?

Example scenario: Your EC2 instance needs to attach to an existing VPC. Show how you’d do it.

Performance & Scaling

Large Infrastructure

How do you speed up terraform plan for a large codebase?

How do you split monolithic Terraform code into multiple state files or workspaces?

Parallelism

What is -parallelism flag in Terraform apply? When would you tune it?

Troubleshooting & Debugging

Drift Detection

How do you detect drift in resources managed by Terraform?

What steps do you take if Terraform wants to replace a critical resource unexpectedly?

Terraform Debugging

How do you debug Terraform errors?

Explain TF_LOG=TRACE and when you’d use it.

Real-World Challenges

Zero-Downtime Deployments

How would you update a database password using Terraform without downtime?

How do you roll out a change that requires recreating an autoscaling group?

Sensitive Data

How do you handle secrets (like DB passwords, API keys) in Terraform?

Difference between using sensitive = true and using a vault provider.

Cloud Provider Specific

Provider Versioning

How do you lock a specific provider version?

What happens if HashiCorp releases a breaking change in a provider you use?

Multi-Cloud Setup

How do you configure multiple providers (like AWS + GCP) in a single Terraform project?
